heyy emily this is matt :),1,
to answer your question i’m going for econ,1,
did you apply to any other california schools?,1,
hi!! yeah i wanna study developmental psych and usc has some crazy interesting programs ,0,
i also applied to claremont mckenna (ngl super last minute haha) bc i might wanna go into policy/govt and they’re great for that! ,0,
you’re like business/finance then right? where else did you apply haha,0,
HAHA no way! i also applied to usc and cmc. i love the interdisciplinary opportunities they offer at usc. cmc was the only claremont college that made sense for my major tbh,1,
developmental psych and policy nice! what kind of programs were you looking into? and yeah i’m going down the finance route haha everything about business catches my eye,1,
"so it’s those schools, pepperdine, and scu. I also got into my safety lmu with scholarships but i’m really set on the ucs",1,
wait that’s actually insane i take it back you’re right we’re basically twins,0,
there’s a professor at usc that teaches psych/pediatrics and leads a research project on early family systems and like my mind was blown when i found that bc it aligned so well w my interests ,0,
that was a really niche example but most of the schools i applied to have some combo of psych/medicine/sociology!,0,
honestly my goals kind of shifted during the app process bc it kind of calls for introspection like i got to know myself a lot better ,0,
ayy i applied scu ea! mm yea fs we’re really lucky that we have the uc’s bc they’re such a good option,0,
I love how you know exactly what you want to do in college,1,
for me I think I just need to do a bit more exploration in different fields because like you said about the entire app process — I found myself being interested in nonprofit work and management too haha ,1,
Loved “there’s a professor at usc that teaches psych/pediatrics and leads a research project on early family systems and like my mind was blown when i found that bc it aligned so well w my interests ”,1,
when you mentioned that introspection it reminded me of the countless why us essays that really made me ask myself if I wanted go to the schools for their opportunities or just because of their brand,1,
Emphasized “honestly my goals kind of shifted during the app process bc it kind of calls for introspection like i got to know myself a lot better ”,1,
i’m just super excited overall for the college experience and joining some clubs on my bucket list. did you have a specific uc in mind?,1,
sorry my reply times are so bad omfg i was rushing to finish an assignment due at midnight,0,
you’re giving me too much credit haha i definitely have a better idea than i did before but i’m interested in a lot of different areas so fs looking forward to learning new things!!,0,
Emphasized “for me I think I just need to do a bit more exploration in different fields because like you said about the entire app process — I found myself being interested in nonprofit work and management too haha ”,0,
"honestly yeah all the essays were overwhelming at the time, but looking back i appreciate how they forced me to reflect on my values and what i want to get out of a college ",0,
yes fs excited for college!! i haven’t looked much into the individual uc’s bc i’m trying not to get toooo attached before i get in (all the schools that made me research for “why us” supps lowkey made me fall in love w the school),0,
wait that was probably what they were intended to do huh HAHA,0,
i know ucsd offers a dev psych major which is a good fit for me! but i’m sure all the uc’s have great and unique opportunities for what i want to do,0,
what about you? any uc’s or clubs in particular?,0,
i felt that hehe,1,
it’s okay i like girls with priorities LOL,1,
Emphasized “yes fs excited for college!! i haven’t looked much into the individual uc’s bc i’m trying not to get toooo attached before i get in (all the schools that made me research for “why us” supps lowkey made me fall in love w the school)”,1,
i think that’s def a valid reason why people don’t have or at least want a dream school because it’ll just be a bigger disappointment if it never goes your way,1,
funny how i say that because i just visited berkeley with my fam last weekend going back from my san francisco birthday trip,1,
some “why us” essays actually made me do the opposite and i removed colleges from my list like pitzer and pomona. those app fees pile up fast too 😵  ,1,
Loved “i know ucsd offers a dev psych major which is a good fit for me! but i’m sure all the uc’s have great and unique opportunities for what i want to do”,1,
yeah fs there are so many great opportunities out there wherever you go,1,
i’m super attached to irvine but ucsd seems like a viable option since my parents are also moving to la jolla,1,
"and i can’t wait to join some asian or filipino club when i go to college. i’m super interested in celebrating and exploring my asian cultural roots. apart from that i’ll probably join  investing, entrepreneurship, and social change clubs like the stuff i do rn",1,
anyway idk how late you stay up but i’m going to try to fix my sleep schedule tn and i’m half-awake rn after my workout so i’m gonna sleep.. good night :)),1,
Laughed at “it’s okay i like girls with priorities LOL”,0,
so is berk the dream 👀 i believe in you!!! you got this!,0,
Emphasized “some “why us” essays actually made me do the opposite and i removed colleges from my list like pitzer and pomona. those app fees pile up fast too 😵  ”,0,
oh dang!! that’s so cool and the area is beautiful ,0,
i know a guy who graduated a couple years back and went to uci for business and he’s in fintech now! he really liked it and had a ton of internship opportunities ,0,
two of my close friends are filipino! hahah but yes yes california and esp the uc’s is THE place to connect w other asians and heritage ,0,
yeah i think im gonna head to bed now too hehe hope you sleep well!!,0,
Loved “so is berk the dream 👀 i believe in you!!! you got this!”,1,
thanks ☺️ but uci is the dream but i just don’t want to get too attached,1,
it really is a beautiful area. my dad described it being like pleasanton except in socal hahaha,1,
Emphasized “i know a guy who graduated a couple years back and went to uci for business and he’s in fintech now! he really liked it and had a ton of internship opportunities ”,1,
that’s so cool! uci is really good for business and fintech is another interesting career i will explore,1,
HAHA really? your friends and i would vibe a lot then. i think that’s another reason why i’m set on california — because of the diversity and other asians,1,
but there are actually a lot of asians in vandy too (elliot choy and moneysigneric hehe),1,
Loved “yeah i think im gonna head to bed now too hehe hope you sleep well!!”,1,
have you visited and had a feel of the east coast?,1,
sorry all my hard classes are today and i have to really focus HAHA,0,
Loved “thanks ☺️ but uci is the dream but i just don’t want to get too attached”,0,
Emphasized “HAHA really? your friends and i would vibe a lot then. i think that’s another reason why i’m set on california — because of the diversity and other asians”,0,
yess oh my gosh i literally wanted to apply bc of elliot choy and moneysigneric !!!!!,0,
also their peabody school has child development which is awesome but i never would have found out about it if it weren’t for them ,0,
noo i haven’t been able to visit the east coast but maybe after i get decisions back to weigh options! my friend visited boston though and she facetimed me HAHA it’s a super nice college town!,0,
how has your day been?,0,
NO WAY i actually told my college counselor friend from lynbrook that i applied to vandy for that exact reason. i removed it for her but then added it back last minute,1,
istg if i get i’ll start vlogging again,1,
Loved “sorry all my hard classes are today and i have to really focus HAHA”,1,
Liked “also their peabody school has child development which is awesome but i never would have found out about it if it weren’t for them ”,1,
ooh let me guess you applied to bu? my parents wouldn’t let me go out-of-state with the exception of some schools,1,
i remember in psych class last year we learned about seasonal affective disorder and these kids in the east coast schools go to these sun rooms where they can get sunlight,1,
and they were all from california LOL,1,
"my day was great, thanks for asking! just had a comp sci exam that gave me a headache. how was your day? your hard classes i mean",1,
Emphasized “istg if i get i’ll start vlogging again”,0,
tufts and wellesley actually (a little outside boston haha)!! i also got into northeastern ea :),0,
no i’m so nervous imma get seasonal depression like pleasanton mornings are lowkey cold for me but i’m sure it’s kind of an adjustment thingg ,0,
if i do move to the east coast i’m gonna have to schedule a sun room visit weekly HAHA that honestly sounds nice though ,0,
Laughed at “and they were all from california LOL”,0,
aw sorry about your cs test :( i forgot i had a stats test so i was trying to study for that during ap chem but i also really have to focus in that class ,0,
so kind of a hectic morning but it all ended up fine!,0,
where else did you apply out of state? ,0,
those are really good schools! my friend ryan ed’d to wellesley and he’s committed,1,
AYY CONGRATS! i’m so happy for you and my other friend (he also did ea),1,
Laughed at “if i do move to the east coast i’m gonna have to schedule a sun room visit weekly HAHA that honestly sounds nice though ”,1,
yeah i’m pretty sure i did well on my cs test it was just a lot,1,
wishing for the best on your stats test tho🤞,1,
i actually applied to cornell because of its renowned hospitality program. my dad was a hotelier so it would be the best of both worlds if i were to gain experience from the best hospitality education and my dad,1,
and upenn as well but you know the selectivity... i’ll most likely go down the finance route at another school,1,
did you do any interviews?,1,
wait are you sure it was wellesley bc wellesleys an all girls school?,0,
Loved “AYY CONGRATS! i’m so happy for you and my other friend (he also did ea)”,0,
Liked “yeah i’m pretty sure i did well on my cs test it was just a lot”,0,
HAHAHAHAHA I APPLIED TO CORNELL TOO but to the college of human ecology ,0,
that’s so cool though! i’ve heard so much about their hotel school but for some reason it didn’t register to me that the hotel industry was an actual thing ,0,
i don’t know if that makes sense i can’t phrase it well but that is so interesting!!!,0,
ooh yeah wharton’s amazing but yeah honestly the whole college app process is so arbitrary ,0,
i think you have a good shot though i don’t know you just come across very collected i think you’d do well in business ,0,
yeah like 3-4 ish? vanderbilt didn’t get back to me though and i missed the request deadline for cmc haha,0,
what about youu,0,
i really made myself cringe i was thinking of wesleyan* when i read that... it’s almost like mixing up usc and uofsc,1,
yeah the hospitality industry is intriguing because it’s not a well-known profession,1,
second time i heard that about upenn! wasn’t too keen on writing their supplements compared to cornell,1,
vandy was def the easiest one (i copied and modified my uc piq haha),1,
aw thank you that’s so sweet of you to say 🥰 i think you have a great shot as well because you come off as very ambitious,1,
Loved “i think you have a good shot though i don’t know you just come across very collected i think you’d do well in business ”,1,
wow i was never aware of the cmc interview request but i interviewed for pepperdine and upenn (upenn was weird because it was over the phone),1,
HAHAHA DW that’s what i assumed i j wanted to make sure but they literally sound so similar ,0,
Emphasized “yeah the hospitality industry is intriguing because it’s not a well-known profession”,0,
Emphasized “vandy was def the easiest one (i copied and modified my uc piq haha)”,0,
Loved “aw thank you that’s so sweet of you to say 🥰 i think you have a great shot as well because you come off as very ambitious”,0,

he just doesn’t think about how to get things cheaper??? like it just doesn’t occur to him to weigh the cost vs gain (like if it’s worth it) i think he j goes w it i really dont know what a blissful existence ,0,
he and my mom are literally polar opposites on that she does not like it HAHAHA he will go out and buy the new iphone/macbook whatever once it drops and my mom deadass got both our current phones for free from a phone carrier deal at an at&t inside ranch 99 😭😭😭 i respect the hustle and now i think like that too so watching my stepdad spend money just blows my mf mind,0,
he didnt even think twice about getting me a car i was gonna get a new truck or his ford explorer or his old mercedes suv (great condition too bc he’s lowkey a clean freak) but my mom said no skdkskska which was probably a smarter decision,0,
but anyway!! i can do tomorrow at like 5:30 if that works for you!!,0,

nespresso>>,1,
ok ik we said we’d let it rest but real quick my hypothesis: he has money now but didn’t really understand growing up how to get deals and stuff. just stuff costs what it costs and you have to pay it. and now that he can afford it he doesn’t think ab if he’s getting taken advantage of bc he figured this is j what it’s supposed to be (and maybe doesn’t want to act/feel poor?),0,
wait is nespresso expensive?,0,
he usually buys the dark blue silver and tannish ones but they all taste the same to me tbh 🥲🥲🥲 i lack a refined palate ,0,
hmm that’s like the opposite of regression in psychology but i don’t know if there’s a term for that or if i j completely forgot it,1,
or maybe he’s having a midlife crisis?? hence his impulsive spending habits,1,
those little nespresso pods are like 70 cents ea so it’s still cheaper than starbucks obviously but they add up especially if you’re a caffeine-lover like me,1,
that’s 511$ a year if you drink 2 cups a day everyday,1,

AHH my phone is 5% and i’m eating dinner i’ll ttyl in 5 mins,1,
i’m back!! work was not too bad i mean i only worked a 2 hour shift to closing time so it’s like running a fast 100m instead of a steady mile,1,
i think i prefer your type of shifts where you only have a few dedicated days in your week where you work for the entire day.. going back and forth throughout the week is meh :/,1,
holy shit em i feel like you spent the entire day in weeple meetings i can’t wait to hear,1,
ok hihi i am back!!,0,
ohhh really! yeah i don’t know it just helps my brain to stay focused on one task and it feels like i’m working less bc it’s only 2-3 days a week,0,
interesting at least now you know for future schedules!!,0,
ok SOO we had a 30ish minute meeting at 11:10 to run down basics for tomorrow which was fine,0,
then we took a 20 min break to eat lunch and my unit facetimed at 12:00,0,
at 2:00 we head to our meeting w coach telos (from michigan) and his meeting with another unit is running long so we check in again at 2:30 still running long we decide to come back at 3:30,0,
^^ which is when i “napped” and rested basically ,0,
also during this time lexi came by my house to drop something off and i went to the wrong car bc i can’t tell cars apart and tried to open the wrong one 🥲🥲 embarrassing not my best moment lexi honked and everything ,0,
"but then we get to our meeting at 3:30 telos says that he completely disagrees w our argument for one of the sections (3 sections/question, we have 2 questions aka testimonies) so basically he says we have to redo 1/6 of the work that we’ve edited and refined for literal months",0,
so we marathon that shit it’s going okay i don’t love that we’re redoing it so close to competition but telos is an upbeat guy and he’s helping guide us ,0,
lexi reallyyyy wants to talk to the other coaches to confirm so we text them and asks to meet at 7:15,0,
so we plan to get off the call at 6:45 so we can get some dinner and j get like a mental break,0,
but no our meeting w telos runs long and we’re trying to end it but he’s so energetic and excited (and doesn’t know we’re meeting w the other coaches that will tear his arguments apart),0,
so this happens ,0,
"we go straight to the other meeting w the other 2 coaches (mcbride: first time head coach this year, incredibly dramatic) (detamore: usually head coach, stepped down this year to focus on family, like a calm uncle)",0,
mcbride is flipping out. he is like maniacal. chuckling like an evil disney villain. he emailed telos. his gestures are very exaggerated. i am afraid. his tone is so condescending. he is super anxious about nationals tomorrow and projecting it on use,0,
detamore is trying to calm mcbride down he’s literally acting like a babysitter. he steps in to be like “yeah that was my suggestion” because mcbride is PISSED whenever telos’ name is mentioned,0,
we read our testimonies and everything and mcbride is giving us crazy eyes the whole time like he’s daring us to do something ,0,
and then after he says he knows what we changed because he’s heard it so many times and we’re thinking oh shit he’s gonna be mad (bc he did not like telos’ idea),0,
"and he says a completely different part (the part i wrote, i just added in an example bc detamore told me to)!!!!!!! HE DOES NOT REALIZE WE FUNDAMENTALLY REWROTE AND REFRAMED A WHOLE SECTION",0,
huh??????? 😀⁉️⁉️,0,
so i’m pissed bc very obviously he didnt even realize what we changed ,0,
so we correct him and he makes us reframe that section again and rephrase all of our arguments ,0,
it was such a pain in the ass especially after we JUST rewrote it,0,
but anyway ! we are good now ! it is fine and over with !,0,
maybe the universe was like these kids complain too damn much lemme give them something to ACTUALLY complain about ,0,
message received yes :D,0,

sorry i j finished watching “your name” w my mom,1,

when you said you were going to nap earlier i didn’t know you would be spending hella hours meeting until dinner time,1,
okay that was long but so basically your coach telos told you to revamp one of your testimonies and then your other coach mcbride told you to revamp another part of your testimony that wasn’t much of a significant change compared to your main section??,1,
that’s such a pain in the ass i’m getting second-hand stress from reading that,1,
also i love how you guys sort of “hide” the fact that you’re meeting w the other coaches like they’ll get jealous,1,
oh wait *cough* mcbride LMAO i’m pretty sure you told me about that,1,

nats went well! we presented question 1 and we’re presenting question 2 tomorrow! all 3 of our judges were male so when we first saw we were like damn 😔 women tend to like us more BAHAH but they ended up being fine!,0,
they asked us really weird questions like super basic/general ones that we already answered in our testimony so it was kind of awk ,0,
"we got a “packing the courts?” question which we’ve gotten a ton, so i went first saying “no” and then before helen could jump in like usual and argue the other side, the judge started questioning me and pushing back on my stance 😭 like give us a second we’re getting there ",0,
"afterwards during feedback they were really nice, even our judge that’s rumored to be really honest (not sugarcoating like most judges do at nats)! they said they hadn’t heard a lot of the stuff that we brought up in our testimonies from other units which is supposed to be really good esp since they had already heard most units before us",0,
but then why didn’t they ask us questions on our unique stuff ☹️ we had evidence and everything i feel cheated BAHAH all that learning and memorizing gone to waste,0,
and then afterwards my unit went to walnut creek hehe and now i am home :) overall a good day!! can’t complain and huge weight off our shoulders now that we actually know what question we’re doing tomorrow so we can prep (we didn’t find out until right before we went),0,

mm you really can’t tell if it’ll be good or bad for you based on the mixed reviews so i think you should at least give it a try and remove it if it doesn’t end up being good for you,1,
i really don’t mind the strings they’re probably not that much of a bother anyway… at least i’ll have the ease of mind that there’s a low risk of pregnancy so maybe i’ll even be MORE active yk,1,

one of my coworkers is lowkey dense though 😭 like me and several others asked him to help set up a grill for a table outside and he agreed but instead cleaned a table ,0,
the thing is it was after we already closed so there’s no need to clean it rn bc there are no customers waiting BUT the outside table not having a grill means they’ll stay longer (bc it was the last table),0,
also they bought me starbucks :D,0,
fei fei is working on mother’s day :( which made me kinda sad i’m gonna buy her some chocolates and write her a card hehe,0,

sorry i j finished washing the dishes,1,
wowwwww who the fuck doesn’t tip that actually makes me so mad… i sometimes get passive aggressive when i see the customers i serve not tip so i “subconsciously” give them 9/10 of the boba scoop instead of the entire one,1,
and then sometimes i try to predict which customers would tip and who wouldn’t based on their demeanor it’s like a little fun guessing game,1,
but now that i think about it i totally understand why japan despises tips because it’s like a measure of your work,1,
and it’s sometimes offensive,1,
i’m glad you got a 33$ tip tho :D,1,
yeahh ik what you mean working a lot puts me on autopilot and it’s kind of nice being productive without something requiring too much thought,1,

work went so fast! today i learned that there was so much drama within the honey tea employees before the current group. joann is the type of boss who likes to talk a lot (kind of like an asian mom gossiping),1,
this may be inaccurate because it was a lot to take in but she mentioned how there was this employee named nolan who had the WORST customer service i mean this guy would completely brush off a customer if they asked for something that’s not possible (like no sugar on citrus/sour drinks),1,
so he eventually left to work for the north face where he got customer service complaints and came running back to joann to work. and then he left again and interviewed for lucky’s where he never got a call back 😬😬,1,
apparently he had a girlfriend named ariel also working in honeytea (she works at bobabliss now) and she would always mess up at work and spill boba because joann later found out that she had too many personal issues (ran away from home cause her dad said to never come back or something like that),1,
that’s another reason why she’s so picky w hiring new employees,1,

we went on a 7-hour tour and headed to the diamond head hiking trail… it’s 2.1 miles — but really really steep!! lots of steps 😅,1,
here’s a pic of us at the top,1,
after that we were soooo hungry so we decided to head to giovanni’s shrimp truck which has the best shrimp on the island,1,
"here are pictures of the spicy and hot shrimp w rice/mac n cheese OH and the frozen yogurt w granola, banana, almonds, and honey",1,
we then went to the dole plantation but it was wayyyy to crowded (i actually went there as a kid and it wasn’t nearly as crowded… john the driver said it was bc of covid),1,
and then on our way to malasadas! i called 30 times until they finally picked up my phone order! got a headache from that but got another headache from the spontaneous flat tire,1,
good thing max is a car guy and got it fixed in no time,1,
the boss driver gave us 50% off for the convenience (originally 500 + 70 tip but we paid 250 + 100 tip bc the driver was working overtime and still went to malasadas),1,
"went swimming in the hotel pool, grabbed super good ramen for dinner (not as good as the one in santana row tbh), and am currently playing smash for the night",1,

and then the second time was a like asian uncle type and he was in an army uniform. he was w a white couple (later found out that theyre also in the army and the asian guy is visiting from texas). when i first went over he asked me my name and then he kept using it whenever i came over saying like oh emily you’re so nice you’re so sweet thank you so much emily and like that’s all fine not really alarming yeah? and he came over to me while i was doing other work which startled me but he j wanted me to make sure he got to pay the check. afterwards i did all the boxing and everything for them and he had a couple special requests which i was happy to honor bc yknow like i respect the troops i think the army’s messed up but i still respect the people who put their lives on the line. anyway! then he was like oh i’m visiting from texas you made this trip so good emily i want to give you something special which started to get more uncomfortable. he said he was gonna tip me and i said oh it goes to everyone and then he said he’d give me something extra and gave me $20 and put it in a hong bao for good luck which was sweet! then he asked me to take a picture for them and i was happy to bc i do for anybody that wants it and this was obv some kind of reunion. and then he told me to get a coworker so i could sit down and be in the picture and i kind of brushed it off. then i suggested we go outside bc they had already eaten all their food so the picture was kind of ugly like just empty/gross plates and after i took pictures of them he gave the phone to his “brother” and asked him to take pictures of us. he told me to take off my mask and i said no HAHAHAH bc a. i don’t wear makeup under my mask at work 😪 and b. i just didn’t feel comfortable fhsjakak. he asked if we had any like cool desserts and i said ahaha no but somi somi is really good so they went there and i was like all good! it’s over! a little later when i was at the register he comes back in and says that he wants his receipt no problem i print it for him again and he tells me that they’re sitting outside our restaurant eating their ice cream. which is mildly concerning but i mean ok so i just avoid going near the front of the building bc it’s all glass window and i’m a little nervous HAHA. it’s like hard to say no to him or say that he’s creepy bc he was nice! and very apologetic the whole time which is kind of uncomfortable like “oh i hope that’s ok” “i know you guys are busy right now i’m so sorry” they stay for like an hour or something but then they finally leave and from the parking lot he waved at me BAHAHAHAH anyway! slightly scary but also nothing bad happened so all good !!!!,0,

it is virtual,0,
you never get to like hold it,0,
you get the virtual pleasure,1,
and look at it,0,
oh my god,0,
it’s like owning a car but virtually,1,
guesssss,1,
that’s so fucking stupid,0,
the recent one,1,
i’m sorry,0,
what is the point of owning a car virtually,0,
i spent money on a knife,1,
yeah i’m sorry,0,
it’s like WEBKINZ,1,
like $9000,0,
that’s so different,0,
you buy the plushies to play them in game,1,
no listen,0,
you bought the stuffed animal,0,
and you can enjoy it like that,0,
you think i buy the webkinz for the stuffed animals???,1,
nah,1,
i buy it for the virtual ~ pleasure ~,1,
or you can go to their virtual platform and interact as the stuffed animal in a different world,0,
Disliked “i buy it for the virtual ~ pleasure ~”,0,

no but at least you jave the stuffed animal,0,
how much are webkinz,0,
pleasure 😏,1,
gimme 2 mins,1,

"Prices on this skin varies massively. At the lowest end, Blue Gems will cost you between $500-$1,000. At the top end, this can extend all the way from $5,000 - $10,000, and beyond in the rare cases.",1,
so dumb,0,
NO WAY SAME,1,
Laughed at “NO WAY SAME”,0,
who has that kind of money to blow,0,
literally what in game pleasure do you get,0,
i think one time my sisters and i were at one of the shops,1,
is it advanced or something,0,
the codes were on the tag and we did our teamwork of opening the tag and taking pictures of the code,1,
like does rhe weapon hiv you special powers,0,
invalid tho :(,1,
no it’s simply the aesthetic,1,
oh what????,0,

you guys were smart though,0,

yeah but those elevate and expand my gameplay ,0,
the $9000 knife adds literally nothing,0,
like zero,0,
except pretty to look at ,0,
nah,1,
the game itself is repetitive right,1,
each round is a different scenario w different strategies,1,
so it’s v immersive in that sense,1,
but what stays EVERY round is the skins,1,
which includes gun skins,1,
and more attractively the knives,1,
which can be switched to a different knife instead of the default one,1,
and then they introduced gloves which also costs hundreds of dollars,1,
csgo is making so much money off of its users ,0,
and these skins,1,
especially the rare ones,1,
because it couldn’t have been very difficult to make ,0,
oh my god they made them rare ones,0,
and the knives especially are SUPER rare to get,1,

yeah like they make less,0,
so it’s more desirable,0,
OH yeah,1,
speaking of making so much money,1,
but there’s not even any product cost or anything ,0,
you have tournaments and people who go pro,1,
just elitism,0,
the tournament grand prize,1,
guess how much,1,
3 million,0,
they don’t make less it’s j a really really slim chance,1,
of what????,0,
okay that’s a bit too much but,1,
slim chance of what,0,
1 million,1,
lame,0,
oh sorry i didn’t explain it,1,
the knives come from cases,1,
so it’s like a lottery system,1,
speaking of lottery there is also gambling sites for these skins,1,
like color galaxy ,0,
to encourage you to keep buying,0,
"so people literally spend thousands if not hundreds of dollars each day trading, gambling, and buying skins",1,
Laughed at “like color galaxy ”,1,
jesus,0,
there was a huge scandal and everything about gambling too,1,
all for this one game,1,
dang,0,
a whole universe ,0,
what did you cheat,0,
like what specifically got you banend,0,
they have these “battle passes” where you get rewards for doing specific objectives,1,
for example kill 100 people via headshot,1,
and it was only a few days left until the season ended where the pass becomes invalid,1,
i wanted some reward but i couldn’t do it in time w/o hacking,1,
so i turned on my aimbot and wall hacks and lets j say my account didn’t last long,1,
pretty idiotic of me to use a free cheat too instead of a premium paid one,1,
given that i lost my knife,1,
okay sorry for that entire spiel this sounds exhausting,1,

mm i’ll update you on my talk w my mom HAHA,1,
hopefully she’s not mad like your mom,1,
oh gosh hopefully ,0,
yoooo 😳😳 that would be perfect for you and your mom,1,
but would you live w her after freshman year??,1,
that would make sense financially,1,
if it’s a 5 BEDROOM house,1,
she was saying maybe she can rent it out to me and probably up to like 9 other students after freshman year bc you could make a lot of money every month,0,
and i was like...... that’s sweet but i feel like you really don’t want to give such a nice house to college students,0,
like she should go live there herself HAHAHAH,0,
if it was $1.5M she would probably sell our house and go buy immediately but it’s definitely not gonna stay at this price HAHA,0,
9 students is a lot of people for a 5 bedroom house i think they would fuck it up,1,
it would be best to have j her living in there especially since it costs so much already,1,
mm you’re right that’s j the starting price,1,
we’ll seeee i bet she’s keeping a close eye on it to see if it will increase,1,

reminds me of a romanian mansion,1,
so prettyyyyy,0,
there must be a reason why,1,
i jave not seen a romanian mansion but i believe you,0,
hidden faulties?,1,
i think it’s just so you price low and male buyers bid so the price goes way up,0,
well is your mom gonna start an offer?,1,
at the listed price,1,
should ask the seller to see if someone already made a bigger offer,1,
yeah we requested to schedule a tour and my mom put a note like “would love to hear the price. ready to put in an offer.” or something,0,
HAHAHA okay okay sounds good,1,
that would be amazing if you ended up getting it,1,

that’s a valid reason,1,
true true that does make sense,0,

yeah for sure for sure,1,
i told my sisters “mama is gonna kill meeee” because we’re getting in-n-out rn and nina was like “no you’re not”,1,

did you want to talk ab your relationship w your parents?,0,
not really but ig why not,1,
i j that there are times where i feel like a bad son or that i’m not spending more time w them,1,
my mom for example sometimes she talks to me driven by her emotional state rather than talking it out nonchalantly like my dad,1,
kinda sounds like i’m explaining the wheels on the bus controversy you told me about HAHAHA,1,
but anyway that leads us to having fights like she is my sibling but in retrospect i haven’t been as caring and kind as i should be,1,
thinking about that,1,
and the fact that my dad does everything he can to see his kids everyday makes me contemplate my past decisions,1,
dad would text the fam that he’s already lonely (as a joke ofc but i feel like it’s half-jokingly said) and even bought fish w my sister j to have company (not sure if that’s true but idk),1,
i did decide to go when i was less busy but it somehow got canceled (due to events that were out of my control),1,
so seeing the main actor (gong yoo) sacrifice himself for his soo ah — the way he would always look for and go to her and hold her tight in the midst of potential danger — made me think about how my parents made sacrifices for me,1,
i sometimes get frustrated at the amount of time my fam travels during the summer and breaks but ig i haven’t acknowledged that blessing of family time,1,
and i take them for granted every so often,1,

no i definitely relate to that and the fact that i know they would make those sacrifices for us over and over again really hits deep especially when you realize you’re not thinking of or showing your appreciation enough ,0,
i think it’s also a part of being young as well like you want to get away from home ,0,
but that’s why i’m so scared my mom will die like tomorrow and she’ll never know how much i really love her,0,
but we’re gonna be better 😤😤😤,0,

i actually don’t care so much about the tip thing bc now ik i can work weekdays without being sad i’m not getting as much business BAHAHAH,0,
very excited ,0,
good things that happened today: 1. i got into the calculus class i wanted! they opened it up more 2. my manager told me he wants me to work more and this other guy to work less he doesn’t know why helen only scheduled me one day which is relieving BUT it also works out bc 3. lexi invited me to this brunch w some girls from berkeley saturday and i’m a little intimidated but i’m excited,0,
biggest of all is 4.,0,
"this group of 7 guys came in and they ordered SO MUCH food! we hace automatic tip (before it was for parties 6+, now we do it for every table 🤭 bc “covid” or something but apparently a lot of restaurants have been doing it so make sure to check the bill, and a lot of customers don’t realize/care and tip again on top of that) so it was already $100 and i was excited ",0,
especially bc yo said helen would probably let us keep it,0,
the guys were being really nice to me like “are you the owner? why are you so nice to us haha” “oh sorry you jave to stay so late well take care of you we’ll write that you get all the tip” and i just kind of laughed it off bc i’m the only girl working so it’s not unusual ,0,
also side note kevin said that they were thinking about hiring more girls bc apparently their tips are so much worse when it’s all guys working HAHHA so i feel like it’s definitely not bc helen doesn’t like me or something ,0,
but i was cleaning a table w yi within their earshot and we were chatting about like class registration and i said yeah i couldn’t get into this data science class ,0,
and one of the guys at the table turns around and is like data???? ,0,
apparently the group of guys are like important people at this korean data company in san ramon and they pulled up articles about their company to show us HAHAH,0,
and they offered me an internship and gave me their emails and found out that my coworker is getting a masters in cognitive science at ucsd and apparently a lot of their guys have masters from ucsd and they offered him one too,0,
i think they might be more excited about him now bc he actually knows stuff 😪 but it’s whatever like i’m just really happy and grateful for the opportunity ,0,
"and they tipped on top of the service charge $300 so we each (yi, me, coworker) get $100 😋",0,
very very good day i am very very happy ,0,

"so this is the house of the ropes mansion. the owner of the house nathaniel ropes died of smallpox and her sisters died of tuberculosis. the wife, abigail, was the only person left who looked over it. abigail was regarded as v strange as she had a fit like when every time someone would try to say hi she would respond in an angry matter. i think at one point she beat someone with a cane because she’s j like that. so on one night she accidentally caught fire on her dress, which spread to her bedsheets, which eventually spread to her entire room. the maids downstairs thought that she was j being her usual self screaming and throwing a fit upstairs saying “you deal w her this time because i already dealt w her” but it wasn’t until the smelled the smoke! they put out the fire but abigail later grew all of these infections where she slowly succumbed to “a distressing illness of three weeks caused by her clothes accidently taking fire.”",1,
here’s the scary part,1,
"not long ago in 2009 the ropes mansion caught fire. the plaster ceilings were destroyed, as were the carpets and wallpaper",1,
but this hadn’t been the first time that the Ropes Mansion was ablaze. a family who moved into this house in 1891 recounted how the home had been set alight,1,

and this is gonna sound pretentious but our fam’s expectations are so high because we’ve been to places like santorini and cinque terra,1,
the tour was mostly trees and you couldn’t really see much imagine taking a tour around pleasanton but w some beach views,1,
i remember one thing and that was one gas station that was super small and it costed like 50 cents a gallon ,1,

heyy,1,
in all honesty it was ADEQUATE i felt like i got scammed of my money AND time,1,
but more importantly it was nice getting scammed w my friends yk,1,
but that’s something you should expect in the night market and the food was still yummy nevertheless,1,
i think the hawaiian cone thing was the best dessert there by far it was so yummy 🤤,1,
might have to get it again on the other days hehe,1,
but yeah remember when i said i wanted boba we ended up going to boba bliss which was prob the best move bc adelric said the boba there was the same one we got for free at amador,1,
sooooo..... not adequate  ,0,

i felt like the could’ve explained the logistics more but then again they’re not really good w logistics (like nayoung’s bday trip to sf),1,
but the fact that they treated you really shows they care i’m glad that worked out for you,1,
"imma list the stuff we got, how much i had, and what i rate it: pho tacos (one bite, 6 they took forever and also i was nauseous) and pork belly fries (1 fry, 5 they were $20 and also i was nauseous but we got this together 3 years ago so nostalgic), chloe got squid and shared (one bite, 3 they were pretty but i did not like it personally), bucket drink (1/2 rest is in my fridge, 5 pretty and good bc i was superrr thirsty but the sales guy was so confrontational and the drink was super lemonady and not as pretty as advertised)",0,
omg i forgot the j,0,

Emphasized “but the fact that they treated you really shows they care i’m glad that worked out for you”,0,

"so basically it’s 4 guys: junghy (chloe’s bf), abe, lucas, and yingli ",0,
and it’s more like nayoung is friends w them but it makes sense for chloe to be there bc her bf is there and she’s best friends w nay,0,
and they’ve literally been best friends since 5th grade,0,
i forgot: lucas (bday boy) not relevant but helpful,0,
so i just feel kind of awkward being there didn’t really bond w any of the guys but overall i’m happy i went and got out of my comfort zone,0,
but yeah definitely frustrating that they all suck at planning,0,

i asked about their most popular drink and he said “do you like jasmine? bc the people that order it REALLY like jasmine and if you don’t know that you REALLY like jasmine like you haven’t had it before and just want to try it out you should get something else. and not jasmine like the tea but jasmine the flower it’s really floral. we introduced it to the menu first as jasmine and then added soda. but yeah don’t order the drink unless you REALLY KNOW that you like jasmine”,0,

it looks like poptropica was made in adobe flash with its own adobe language but i’m also not sure how relevant that is rn since it might be deprecated,1,6.63577423665e+17
but you can also j say that you’re exploring the languages behind their games and ask them what ways you can be prepared if you were to take on this role,1,6.635775395459997e+17
i think the fact that you already have experience w CS61A it will show that you’re already taking that initiative,1,6.63577575628e+17
oh i see,1,6.63577596496e+17

OK so the story is that I woke up this morning and I was wiping after he Peed and I Saul like fresh red blood on the toilet paper and so obviously I was confused because I have my ID and I haven’t had a period for you many many months and I do remember that last night when I took my skirt off I did see that there was some like some kind of blood on the inside of the skirt but because I haven’t had my period in so long I was like oh my gosh that must be a stay in from like super long ago and it’s embarrassing that I you know that I haven’t cleaned it yet I was like I can’t believe I missed that and I you know I wear the skirt all the time I got some berries and it’s kind a like hit it but now I’m realizing that was probably not old like not an old stain,0,6.639739860371539e+17
And so at the time I was like oh I should do you know I should just bleach that like because I didn’t think that it was going to be fresh blood and so now I think it’s I think I just got I don’t really know what’s going on but I’m not in any pain oh him I’m just confused I didn’t do some light googling and I was gonna see if I could call like Planned Parenthood or something but I don’t I don’t think it’s an option but I’ll keep googling but I think I’m just not really sure so I was confused I think it’s OK,0,6.639740683391478e+17

but also i was trying to exchange the jacket today w my mom and we were gonna take luna but luna was bad so we had to go home and drop off luna and then we were almost at broadway plaza and i was crap i don’t think i brought the jacket and then i was like wait doesn’t mary alice have drawing so we had to drop off mary alice at drawing 15 min late and then we walked around farmers market for a little and now i’m walking luna for a bit bc we have to wait for mary aluces class to end and then we’re gonna go to broadway plaza again,0,6.639742584252193e+17

"I'm surprised nobody's posted pt. 2 of this copypasta yet, guess I'll have to be the one to do it...

Hey, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is actually not the most compatible Pokémon for humans? This is a common and understandable misconception, however Vaporeon has it's human on Pokémon breedability outclassed by it's cousin evolution, Umbreon. Umbreon weights approximately 60 pounds, or around 27 kilograms, and is 3'3"" tall (About a meter), making it not only large enough to appropriately handle human genitalia, but also light enough to easily be lifted, and promptly set back down repeatedly. It's relatively small size would also prove a tight entry, which is always a good thing. Umbreon also boasts an extremely impressive defensive stat spread. With it's combination of very high HP, Defense, and Special Defense stats, it can take a great pounding and come back for more! It's ability, Inner Focus, allows it to keep slamming attentively, without getting fatigued. Umbreon also has access to the ability Synchronize, which allows it to share it's current status with you, meaning you will receive all of the pleasure it feels COMBINED with all the pleasure you're getting from pounding this perfect breedable Pokémon. Umbreon also has the capability of seeing perfectly in pitch-black darkness, allowing it to effectively attend a midnight fornication session. Even if you do manage to drain Umbreon's energy with all the furious thrusts, it can recover very quickly with its access to the move Moonlight. Its black fur is also a giant positive attribute, allowing all the excretions you make to be easily seen all over its body. A great fun fact, Umbreon can excrete toxins in its sweat, which would in turn soak into your member and swell it up, making it even more sizable and sensitive. This would not only enhance the experience for you, but for your Umbreon as well (Which with Synchronize, ends up pleasing you exponentially more). Umbreon's wide movepool also supports the hypothesis that Umbreon is the best Pokémon to breed with. It can learn Payback, which doubles in power after the Pokémon is hit, meaning Umbreon with throw it back twice as hard as normally if you're hitting it good. Umbreon can also learn Guard Swap; it could give YOU its insane durability, and go crazy on you all night with your now massive endurance. Speaking of endurance, Umbreon also has access to Endure, making it practically immune to fatigue, it will always have energy left over. Charm is also within Umbreon's movepool, letting it be extremely seductive towards you, easily getting you in the mood. Umbreon can also use Taunt, in turn making you ONLY able to to attacking moves such as Slam, Pound, etc; none of that foreplay shit, right into the action. It also has access to Sleep Talk, giving it the ability to not only give consent in its sleep, allowing access to any of its ports and any time, but also move in it's sleep, making it an effective 24/7 fuckmate. Umbreon still has even more great moves that good to have while smashing, such as Quick Attack, allowing swift slams and bounces, which can have even greater power if Umbreon uses Curse beforehand. Curse would also raise Umbreon's defense, making it able to take powerful thrusting for almost any duration. Looking back, Umbreon's slightly small size ensures a gorilla grip cavity and easy physical manipulation. Its ungodly bulk allows it to take poundings for hours on end and resume after recovering with moonlight (Which works even better when it's sunny). It's access to the abilities Inner Focus and Synchronize allow it to unwaveringly throw it back and add all of its pleasure onto yours, effectively making it twice as amazing as any other Pokémon, or even FOUR TIMES, factoring in the doubled power of payback of course. All of this information in combination with its extremely useful movepool in the world of intercourse makes Umbreon the Pokémon most qualified to breed with humans; able to take dick of any shape, any size, in any position easily for extensive periods of time, while having the ability to return for even more mere seconds later.",0,6.63986577636819e+17

"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.",0,6.63986828835992e+17

so i actually wanted to make our valentines day/anniversary logistics a surprise but i came to the realization after reading your text that it’s not practical to do that since you need to know in advance what we’re doing. since the actual date is on a monday i was thinking of celebrating the weekend before where i’d pick you up from berkeley and surprise you w amador spa couples massage tickets and do that in the afternoon. then we’ll have our own time walking in the shaffer ranch trail like we did for pink moon picnic. then we’d have a romantic dinner at din tai fung (hard to do) or some other fancy sit down. then possibly use my xmas gift somewhere private hahaa and cuddle and watch a valentines day movie. we’d drive back early monday morning,1,6.646967929076767e+17

gosh i hope i don’t have it,0,6.647824822744312e+17

oh right ok what’s up w him ,0,6.647825352885161e+17
i don’t know the details but if you tested negative that’s a great start but like i said we really don’t know until the test later this week,1,6.647825690239999e+17
ok so andrew picked me up in his car and i kind of expected where this was going,1,6.647825993209998e+17
there’s this girl that he was talking to named charlize (also from the bay area who goes to sdsu) and she’s been talking to him for ~2 months a few months after she broke up w her bf,1,6.647826490130001e+17

"long story short he made a move on her asking to kiss her, which it went well until the next few days she was being dry so something was up",1,6.64782761582e+17
andrew asks what’s up and she was p much not ready for it after her last relationship and so he was in the dumps crying a lot bc he did catch feelings,1,6.64782828005e+17
so we talked a lot and i gave some advice and we even sang daniel caesar together it was a v nice bonding experience,1,6.64782860766e+17
"it’s funny cause i thought to myself i never had a real, genuine best friend but i think andrew is the definition of that",1,6.647828828239999e+17
anyway even if you do test positive i still kind of want to go w you j maybe social distance LOL,1,6.647829384390002e+17

my day was good and productive! spend the entire day looking over my 50+ page hw assignment and did extra credit for linear (still doing it now) so i’m rushing to complete it so i can get enough sleep for the test tomorrow,1,6.66768196777e+17
but i j got off the call w andrew and he said that he and charlize have been hitting it off like they talked until 6am one night (with another friend in the room) and she said she bought IT TAKES TWO FOR THEM TO PLAY but andrew was like nah i don’t think that’s a good idea and that he’s v confused since it’s obviously a couple game and she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. she said yeah i can see how it’s confusing but i miss how well we hit it off and i still have that strong feeling for you and andrew was like no because get this,1,6.66768310353e+17
no because she suggested they can start something after she’s over her ex,1,6.667683571420003e+17
the other day after he saw charlize he had a second wave of sadness hit him so he cried on the roof of his dorm (this was all before she suggested them getting together) his friend said “do you know about charlize?” to him and andrew was like “no” and he was like “nvm nvm”,1,6.667684114210001e+17
so when the friend group was all together charlize had to excuse herself suspiciously and her friend took her seat,1,6.667684308830002e+17
she called everyone and she had covid and she still hung out w andrew and everyone the day before without telling them… AND THIS WAS ON ANDREW’S BDAY TOO,1,6.66768457279e+17

and i dont even like fully really want to go ??? like i don’t know but i think it’s important to like meet people and katelyn knows everyone and i like aly and id like to get closer to them both but 😭  ,0,6.675453249177366e+17

￼,0,6.675453996852858e+17
baby if YOU don’t want to go — don’t go!!!! this is your body and mind telling you that you need rest and to not worry about these plans tn. there’s always more opportunities to hang out w katelyn too i’m sure they’ll understand that you can’t go bc you missed bid pickup,1,6.675454212540001e+17
and everyone i would usually go out with is out of town??? ,0,6.675454226975558e+17
emily mao isn’t here neither is jules neither is jayda neither is chloe and i just don’t know ,0,6.675454548264105e+17
i dont need to rest i literally haven’t been out since tuesday and my classes are hella easy,0,6.675454895318456e+17
and i didn’t even go out tuesday it was a sorority event,0,6.675455010569312e+17
i really think it’ll be like good for me in the long run but it’s a lot of stress right now ,0,6.675455238726794e+17
and about jhere she is not worth your time or energy anymore!!!! you tried being nice to her in the past but she never reciprocated that back so what good would it make to try to rebuild a healthy relationship that never existed in the first place,1,6.67545531109e+17
bc im not in control like i don’t know anyone i don’t know anything going on i just feel like bad about myself and the situation if that makes sense ,0,6.675455560859983e+17
but that’s not gonna change unless i put myself out there and try to meet people and get involved do yk what i mean ,0,6.675455755454144e+17
i hear you,1,6.675455821549999e+17
like if i stay in and don’t go then i’ll just keep feeling like this ,0,6.675455895642998e+17
i just don’t know why she’s so mean to me and i can feel her energy towards me ,0,6.675456156480462e+17
but do you think this is j a bad coincidence where everyone is out of town? i mean everyone you named like emily jules jayda and chloe,1,6.675456264750002e+17
that’s a lot of people!!! they j all happen to be out of town,1,6.67545635831e+17
i don’t have work tomo and i tried thinking of people to hang out w but they’re all busy so i understand a teeny bit,1,6.675456738049998e+17
it sucks baby,1,6.675456832829999e+17

but katelyn and aly both live in sd so if im close w them i could see them ,0,6.675457108746796e+17

i’m so sorry you’re feeling this way i wish there was a simple solution for all of this but it’s tricky yk,1,6.675457561240001e+17
why is it so hard ,0,6.675457642905829e+17
like in your case it’s so hard bc berkeley is a HUGE public school whereas i’m in a v small community college where it’s easy to see the same people,1,6.675457915740001e+17
and everyone’s trying to find people,1,6.675457987219999e+17
in berkeley,1,6.675458043e+17
i just feel so socially stupid like i don’t know why it’s so hard and i’m trying but like is it this hard for everyone ,0,6.675458156036481e+17
you’re not socially stupid baby,1,6.67545829225e+17
i’m 10000000% sure SO many other students are feeling the same way,1,6.675458415789999e+17
zach has been feeling that way too,1,6.67545847819e+17
ig up until now he’s been getting closer w people from his consulting club but other than that he’s having a hard time,1,6.675458755089998e+17
you’re not alone baby don’t feel like you’re socially stupid bc you’re not socially stupid,1,6.67545891856e+17
don’t forget you’re hanging out w fang next week,1,6.675460088430002e+17
and you’ve been able to hang out w your roommates at basketball games,1,6.67546036169e+17
no but i put myself out there i try and then it’s just like so hard and it makes me feel embarrassed and lonely and exhausted and ik everyone goes throguh it and i’m doing ok on the surface like i have friends but it’s like why cant i be more successful at it do you know what i mean it’s like the paddling duck syndrome ,0,6.675460899653454e+17
it’s just like you have to be so vulnerable bc you can do so much but ultimately it’s like up to other people ,0,6.675461335111423e+17
yeah i can visualize that,1,6.675461349299999e+17
but like what is my alternative you know?? ,0,6.67546171476016e+17
i am happy being by myself thats not an issue i love hanging out with myself i think i’m so funny and i’m totally fine doing a lot of things alone which i know some people like just can’t be alone but at some point it’s like you do crave friends and i just don’t know ,0,6.675462304533358e+17
i’m so grateful for you and that you’re my person i can’t imagine dating that must be like hell ,0,6.675463070559663e+17
"so your situation is that you are trying really really hard to make friends (which you are) but these friends aren’t friends you would classify as REAL friends? or that you are trying really hard to make new friends, and that you aren’t getting the results that you expected",1,6.675463714879999e+17
￼good question costar ,0,6.675463739985933e+17
costar is not accurate and it often goes for our neck,1,6.675464006019997e+17
Questioned “i’m so grateful for you and that you’re my person i can’t imagine dating that must be like hell ”,1,6.675464357032637e+17
i feel like making friends is lowkey like dating like you don’t know what the other person thinks about you you don’t know if they’re seeing other people like i haven’t really dated but i feel like it’d be really emotional and stressful all the time ,0,6.67546545357757e+17
i agree,1,6.675465969169998e+17
so i’m really grateful that we got it right like early on if that makes sense like at least this is going really well for me HAHAHAH even if other things aren’t ,0,6.675466177706359e+17

i’m really grateful too:),1,6.67546649928e+17
ig it’s unrealistic but just to have like really good friends that you can rely on and you know they reciprocate affection like you’re each other’s priorities like on a deeper level you’re there for one another ,0,6.675466773653293e+17
and i have one on one friendships but i don’t do as well in groups and i just don’t know ,0,6.675466982629332e+17
i never had like super solid friend groups or community or anything so i mean i guess i don’t 100% know what it’s like either but i’d like to have it ,0,6.675467467378097e+17
and it just makes me feel lonely ,0,6.675467535823951e+17
do you show those vulnerabilities to your 1-1 friends? i feel like that will help move your relationship farther,1,6.67546762189e+17
Loved “i’m really grateful too:)”,0,6.67546763746156e+17
i don’t really want to be vulnerable with them i think i would feel clingy and pathetic,0,6.675468394568453e+17
and then fear of them like pushing me away yk ,0,6.675469096527598e+17
"it’s really hard to find those solid friend groups in a large public school, because people who you fuck with might not fuck with another girl",1,6.67546938295e+17
"unless you’re in some organization, where it’s easier for those groups to form right",1,6.675469599570001e+17
you won’t be clingy and pathetic,1,6.67546969404e+17
you really won’t find real friends unless you take that risk (but you need to trust them that they won’t take that for granted),1,6.67547008331e+17
i got rejected from the only club i applied to and couldn’t make the tryouts for the other one 😀,0,6.675470120027016e+17

well fuck that club because of their elitist system and how shitty they were at communicating the website stage,1,6.67547099109e+17
also the tryouts was j an unfortunate coincidence,1,6.675470996359999e+17
they were actually really nice and encouraged me to apply next semester which i probably will hahahah,0,6.67547120266525e+17

"chi o event, more basketball games w chloe , hanging out w 1-1 girls like jayda or emily or aly",1,6.675472587399941e+17
about having this feeling of being a rebound and having this tear in my heart,1,6.675472861913559e+17
letting him know i can cry at night,1,6.67547298287456e+17

"yes i do wish you would have told me earlier because i was really looking forward to seeing you and it feels like i got canceled on last minute. yes i would have preferred if you didn’t plan to hang out w your friends the night before the 7 am shift you decided to pick up before you agreed to come see me, esp after i had said multiple times earlier today and before that i understand if you’re tired or you don’t want to drive in rush hour traffic. and so i felt frustrated and disappointed. but i understand you wanted to do it all and you have a strong sense of obligation and duty to everything you do, i know that i’m not perfect either yk and i know that things come up and things happen and we don’t always see these situations coming up. so i understand and of course i forgive you. and i would much rather you be well rested and prepared for your interview than drive on 2 hours of sleep. i also don’t want you to resent me if your interview goes poorly bc you don’t feel well, and i would hate myself if you got into an accident.",0,6.703822450540137e+17

"i know it’s not mature for me to cry rn but i am because i’m trying my best to balance everything in my life w school, work, my friends, family, and you. the reason why i decided to hang out w my friends the night before my 7 am shift was because alex was leaving for the week on thursday and i already flaked out on the LA trip, so like you said, i felt like i had an obligation to commit to them. i was literally about to drive over a few minutes ago bc of how horrible i felt, and i honestly stopped feeling tired because of that. i also feel like i’ve disappointed my family for not even going to the family reunion this upcoming weekend and missing my mom’s bday celebration since i have school on tuesday. i feel like i disappointed everyone i love this week at the expense of work, school, and trying to balance everything all at once. i’m trying my best but it feels like i’m not doing that",1,6.70382909688e+17

you’re really doing the best you can so there’s no need to put more pressure onto yourself and it does suck that there will be nights like these where you’re feeling sad that you don’t have any “real” friend to talk to,1,6.70567537909e+17
i was super lucky to find some people at DVC but we don’t really talk outside of that and i don’t text or have a deep conversation w the boys too much bc we’re always busy doing our own thing,1,6.705676198140001e+17
to be quite honest those nights where we get together are p rare nowadays,1,6.70567661151e+17
yes i could talk to the boys about relationship stuff bc we all have a say about that kind of stuff,1,6.7056783746e+17
but for all of the other 90% of things i don’t have anywhere to really talk about my feelings except for you so i’m v grateful for you,1,6.705678914780001e+17
everything i j said was kind of scattered but the most important thing is that you're doing all you can!! j be patient and eventually you’ll stumble upon people you click w in the future 😊,1,6.7056802146e+17

like ive never really had a friend group where im close to everyone,0,6.705682084485779e+17
the closest is probably nay chloe and clara and we rarely hang out ,0,6.705682499746048e+17
and i just don’t know like how to even make that group happen ,0,6.705682879502029e+17
bc it’s something i’d like to have in my life and it feels like it just comes so naturally to everyone else ,0,6.70568309826914e+17
and i genuinely like i don’t know why it’s always been so hard for me like i still don’t know how to do it,0,6.705683473731843e+17
i can form one on one friendships okay but i still have a hard time initiating ,0,6.705683694554377e+17
and so my therapist said i could try setting something up like inviting multiple people ik together and stuff but like that’s just so far out of my comfort zone or anything i’ve done before ,0,6.705684039939401e+17
i just don’t get it i don’t know why it feels like everyone knows something i dont and it makes me really sad ,0,6.705684372754248e+17
i must say it is natural for me to become close to people in the hawaii friend group or the boys bc,1,6.705684687690001e+17
we were in a close environment in high school so forming these “pods” (especially during lunch time) were almost necessary to fit in,1,6.705685102890001e+17
and then these pods j happened to become closer and closer throughout the four years (or even more! bc some were friends since elementary),1,6.70568539131e+17
"whereas in college, let alone a public university, these pods no longer necessary and it’s a bigger pool",1,6.705685784550002e+17
that’s probably why it was natural for you to form the friend group with clara nay and chloe,1,6.705685923039999e+17
at dvc it’s super small so i was able to find gabe but we don’t really have a friend group,1,6.70568629629e+17
so that proves it’s hard to make friends in college bc everyone has so many different schedules / lives which i discovered,1,6.705686828860001e+17
i mean that’s actually not a bad idea i know that in the last social adrienne invited this girl who joined project bracket bc she was lonely to get froyo after,1,6.70568822331e+17
i think it’s all about trial and error too bc when i went out w gabe and tom it was nice and had some good conversations but we didn’t really click as a group and that was the last time we hung out together despite us saying we should do it again (we actually said we should do it every thursday),1,6.70568883612e+17
but i think that something that everyone knows is,1,6.705689477350002e+17
going out of their comfort zone,1,6.705689595439999e+17
"you need to go out of your comfort zone to branch out w the friend group thing. you already got out of your comfort zone to branch out to individual people like aly, which is fucking GREAT",1,6.705690096369998e+17
baby. my best friend moved after freshman year and i literally dipped and my friend group fell apart and lunch was a major source of anxiety for me for the next year and a half. i did not figure it out i just opted out i would literally go home this is not a good example ,0,6.705692054144284e+17

"ive done some reflecting and i think i haven’t really been feeling loved recently, and i feel like i’m being irrational bc really it’s just the past couple of days. i know you’ve been stressed out, and it probably doesn’t help that i don’t have that many people other than you that i’m close to, so more pressure is on you, but idk that’s just how i feel. it would mean a lot to me if you planned something for us to do, bc i feel like lately we’ve been spending a lot of time in my space, like my dorm my house my sorority, and i feel more stress in those circumstances. like i love watching tv and cuddling w you but i also like to do things yk? like we don’t have to go out to eat or spend a lot of money but id like to cook something new ourselves or go on a hike or go to sf or an event or something. also when we’re in bed or watcjign something we always end up falling asleep, and i dont really like that either bc i feel like we lose so many hours. also, ik you didn’t mean to hurt my feelings or anything, but i put a lot of effort into getting ready for our dates and trying to look nice for you. i understand you wanting to take candid pictures and i appreciate that you want to take pictures of me, and ik you say they’re for you, but if i get a picture where i look bad or feels rushed/blurry it lowkey feels like a slap in the face like i wasn’t worth the effort of taking an extra second for a nice picture yk? and i get like funny or casual pictures when we’re relaxed, and not every picture has to be like the best picture but that instance just really rubbed me the wrong way ig. idk and looking back i think when i was trying to get your opinion on my shopping, you really didn’t care which is fair, but i was trying to get you engaged like if i wesr something you like you’d care more or something but that just made me feel worse HAHA and then in a similar vein yk the sex toys today. i came last night and it was j really good and i was like damn i wish i could w matt, and i’ve been feeling guilty bc i wish i could w you, and you’ve tried so hard. i was hoping that was something we could maybe connect over but then that didn’t go well either. i dont really know what to say, i didn’t mean for this to get so long and it’s a lot of rambling but i feel like i needed to get it off my chest. ofc this is j my perspective so feel free to talk about your pov too and get that out too.",0,6.706557469659336e+17

"thank you for sharing that with me, emily. i don’t think you’re being irrational, because i felt as if the past few days have been off in a sense where there has been things in our relationship that we would have improved on a long time ago, but we procrastinated on that and it sort of caught up on us or piled up over time. it means a lot to me that we discuss this now rather than later so that the pile doesn’t get any larger than what it has already become. 

it does feel like i am your only outlet for your feelings, which is normal for any relationship, but it also comes at a cost where i am taking a lot of pressure like you said. but i want you to know that my love for you outweighs any bad or stressful day that we endure in this relationship. 

i do think that we’ve been spending a lot of time in your space to the point where it’s becoming repetitive and dull. but also keep in mind that we both have differing schedules and it is difficult to even start to think about doing something new, because i don’t want you to skip class because of me. i was content i was even able to see you for a week. although i do understand where you are coming from because i recently saw lexi’s post where she went to big sur with her bf california and i thought to myself, “damn i wish i could do that with emily”. i also understand that your dorm and the sorority are stressful environments that you would not wish to mix with me, especially what happened the last time i visited. but i truly do have these thoughts of doing something new like have you stay with me in la jolla or going to the keshi concert during the summer. however, i am without a doubt guilty of lacking in the planning department recently (i.e. not following through with our SF plans at golden gate park), and i think i could definitely improve on that from here on out. as a matter of fact, i have house until next monday, so perhaps we can plan a big trip within the next week.

i appreciate you for investing your time and effort into looking good for our dates, i almost feel insecure by your beauty and attire each time i go out walking next to you in my basic uniqlo clothing. initially, i found it funny and cute to take candid pictures of you, but i guess i didn’t fully grasp the feelings you had behind the camera, so i apologize for that. i’ll wait for your green light.

i’m not going to try and justify the fact that i cared about your shopping, because in all honesty i didn’t — all of the skirts looked the same to me and whatever you choose will look good on you regardless. if we were shopping / thrifting in-person then that sounds more fun (which is something that we should do btw). as for the sex toys today, i wasn’t in the mood to even think about sex because i was exhausted from the stress i experienced from earlier today, but i apologize for unfairly not communicating that to you, but i am looking forward to see what you purchased.

i get a little sad when i hear that you can cum and no matter how hard i try during sex there is nothing i can do to satisfy you — it’s always about satisfying me. although sex isn’t the main thing that defines our relationship, i think it’s still an important factor and we should take small steps to get you to finally orgasm.

if you didn’t tell me, i would never have known. it’s important to have these off my chest conversations like the time we established transparent communication after our trip to kmart last year. hope you have a good homework sesh, good night, and i love you, always.",1,6.706583221210001e+17

"i agree that there are some things that have been like mild issues but have persisted over time so i’m glad that were talking about it now too

yeah :’) im sorry you’re my only outlet, i really am trying to connect w other people and better my mental health though

ik it’s hard to coordinate schedules and plan activities, but even something small beyond hanging out in a bed and watching tv/playing games would mean a lot to me, so i hope we can both plan things to work toward that in the future. to clarify, i’m totally not expecting a road trip like lexi and cal, that was during spring break and i’m sure it was a lot of planning and it’s also def easier for them to coordinate bc they go to the same school and neither of them work. also i think our relationship is better than theirs not to compare but i’m just saying. i’m looking forward to hopefully doing something together this summer!

i’ll see you the weekend after this coming weekend yes? but we could also do something this week, we can talk about it more but idk how well it would work bc i’m seeing you on thursday for date party too

there’s no reason for you to feel insecure! do you want to talk about that? i think it is funny and cute, but they can be good quality candids too 😭 the two are not mutually exclusive HAH but i appreciate your understanding

i agree that sex is still an important factor in our relationship, and i’ve felt a lot of guilt about not being able to orgasm w you despite your efforts. even by myself i feel like i really have to concentrate and it usually takes me like 20-30 min, so i was hoping i could buy a toy and we could potentially use it together. i understand you were tired and stressed out, but that’s why i was hurt by the sex toy thing. i thought you would be more excited, but you didnt reallt seem interested, which i took personally and added to my frustration.

"i think in every relationship these conflicts are bound to happen especially when you’ve started to love each other and become more comfortable on a deeper level. i know alex told me this in the car one day when he had bad fights w hanah (but their relationship was much more toxic and did not have effective communication on hanah’s part). i certainly do feel there are times where something ticks me off but i brush it off but i’m not sure if that’s the right move or not. for example, when we were doing leetcode and i tried to stop you from reading the discussion answers, i felt irritated when i was called out for the remote control but i understood you were stressed out then. but like reddit says, it’s about how we approach the issue and talk it out like adults and that’s something i did not to last night even for such a mere, immature issue like feeling neglected for one or two minutes j bc you wanted to catch up w roommates. silence and passive aggressiveness was the wrong move — hopefully we’ll both be able to talk about these conflicts more easily and sometimes it’s easy to forget the importance of communication, so brief reminders are important",1,6.709573267219407e+17

"yesterday was a lot of rides, walking, and eating food!! i’d say my favorite ride was a tie breaker between the incredicoaster which is the newest revision of california screamin but incredibles themed and the star wars rise of the resistance ride. that ride displayed how much ride tech has advanced and i especially liked seeing an entire fleet of stormtroopers which made it look so real. i also took 5mg w a 75 minute wait in line and it felt like i was literally inside of a star wars movie. as for the least favorite ride it would be the other star wars millennial falcon ride because it was j pushing buttons, the display video was laggy, and my grandpa got back pain bc these two middle schoolers couldn’t pilot the ship",1,6.72516577539429e+17

omg do tell,1,6.729070608258776e+17
So my sorority was having a roommate mixer right for people who don’t have roommates yet and I walked over w jayda and we were like hey have you talked to other people ab rooming yet which would be fine and normal ofc and she said yeah she’s been talking to this girl Lauren and I was like well fuck Lauren has hella points she’s gonna room w her. And so we get to the mixer and lowkey some of these girls don’t fuck w me. This one sophomore Anna I like pairs off w a girl Jane and im like ok fuck. I get nervous and so im tryna be like w the remaining couple girls heyyy so do we have any idea who we wanna room w and they’ just do not like me I can tell. They’re like idk well probably reach out afterwards bc its awk on the spot rn and I laugh along but inside imlike fuck I lost all of them they think im weird. Its the video remember that was like “im not gonna win now you think im weird.”,0,6.729086156133408e+17
And so on my way home Im texting jayda bc she left earlier like hey do you know who you’re gonna room w and she’s like its bw you and Lauren so imlike fuck its gonna be Lauren and I have no options. im ready to cry at this point trying not to think about it. Then Maya texts me if im still looking for a roomie bc Anna is looking and I was like wait isn’t she rooming w Jane but have her reach out to me if she is. and so she texts me bc apparently Jane might be homophobic. Her loss my gain hell yeah imma get a good room,0,6.729087186866917e+17

"i’m in a clark kerr quad which is nice! the dorms are really pretty, my room really tall ceilings and some have balconies! it has a reputation of the best food and having athletes/greek life people living there. it is a bit of a longer walk than the other dorms though",0,6.735099288622938e+17
"blackwell is supposed to be the best and fanciest and it’s hella nice, the units are good bc they’re more social and close to campus (1 is slightly better than 2 it’s a block closer and not next to peoples park, i think 3 is more run down), foothill is supposed to be antisocial and it’s far and hilly idrk anyone that lives there but the all women’s dorm, stern, is located there i believe! idk about foothill but the units and blackwell you’ll likely have to ride in an elevator to get to your dorm which i think is annoying but ig you get used to it",0,6.735100554982234e+17

"i don’t think it bothers me, but i feel like it should depending on the circumstances like if it was behind my back, passionate feeling for another, etc.",1,6.740310478146936e+17
it depends but i think i would be fine w it why,1,6.740310714010258e+17
that’s not to say in any case where you kiss a girl without me knowing that it’s not cheating or it “doesn’t count” yk,1,6.740311400297103e+17
idk i feel like it’d be fun and maybe id like to try i j always thought you would be super against it but then i thought i should j ask to see ,0,6.74031307105597e+17
well it depends… is having fun the intention of kissing another girl? or is it to see if you would like it? and what if you did like it?,1,6.740314527061343e+17
wouldnt it be both? if i didn’t like it i wouldn’t have fun no? ,0,6.740316534228154e+17
idk it’s not super relevant or pressing or anything i j wanted to gauge your reaction ,0,6.740317041787416e+17
i feel like it seems there’s a desire to experiment w your sexuality when you’re still in a relationship w me and it was brought up before that you would date a girl if the worst case scenario comes up,1,6.740319323152547e+17
i am going to head to bed baby i have an early class in the morning good night love you!,1,6.740320282501882e+17

"so our door doesn’t always close all the way if we do it gently or close it softly and usually we really like that bc it’s easy to go to the bathroom ty or get food or something yk but late at night if we’re closing it lightly and quietly a lot of the time it doesn’t lock all the way and sometimes it freaks me out but i’m not the last one in the room and i’m like it’s probably fine, but then jhre mentioned her dream and i remembered mine like wait. that has so many similar elements AND were both on the same night. so her dream was that there was a man with a cane and he had grappling hooks and was flying on joans bed and stuff and shooting darts. my dream was my pov i was sleeping (similarity 1) in my old bed (similarity 2, joan’s current bed), and this old man was next to me. he was in a wheelchair but also elevated next to me for some reason idrk. somehow i knew this was author kurt vonnegut (author of slaughter house 5, i knew literally nothing about this man other than his name and he writes). kurt vonnegut was stroking my hand and being creepy and i was watching/feeling it but i couldn’t move. he kept reaching over my sleeping body to put autographed copies of his signed books on a shelf (i think it might’ve been farenheight 451 which i KNOW is written by ray brafbury but i think my brain was struggling bc ik nothing about vonnegut and both books have numbers and are sci fi). eventually this man leaves i think and i fall back asleep. i “wake up” still dreaming, and see joan coming in. i tell her joan you’ll never believe what happened this morning. we talk, she says so creepy i agree, and she leaves to go to shower. she’s gone for a while and so im like where is she and then i think oh crap what if the guys still out there. i go to text her, and then i look up from my phone to see a man crouching in chloe’s bed across from me. he leaps at me (similarity 3: jumping elements), and then my brain flashes to watching kurt vonnegut jump at joan in the hallway. the man ties me to a chair, and i ask him why are you doing this what is all of this. he says bc of my ex. i’m like ??? what is your ex kurt vonnegut?? then a red headed woman steps out from behind him. idk if they said anything but the implication/assumption i made was the woman was kurt’s daughter. unsure why her ex was helping her. they say i can’t tell anyone, that kurt’s not right in the head. then i woke up fr",0,6.741177331949864e+17

oh yeah andrew went on the date w charlize and essentially when he asked if she wanted to be his gf she said no (despite her saying she was ready) and ig the reason was bc she lost a bit of feelings when he we being pessimistic about life and growing up on ft since they both didn’t know he was capable of that and also the fact that she’s gonna be v busy over the summer and following semesters (also planning to transfer junior year) so it was “unfair” for his first honeymoon / relationship,1,6.756617086513376e+17

"Good morning, hope you slept well :)

Again, I’m not trying to rationalize anything or invalidate your feelings, as I definitely know where you’re coming from. I do want to explain the situation a bit though. The month before we dated, my ex and I were implicitly on good terms when we talked about an anime (I posted on my story). Just like how you were able to read your ex’s bad intent with him sending dog pictures on Instagram, I also carefully read the room but sensed no bad intent of the conversation — we still obviously cut all communication thereafter because we moved on.

Fast forward to a few weeks or days ago I get a request on BeReal which I accepted because of my perception of her from that last interaction — barely a friend. Keep in mind this was also more than a year gap of interaction. Yesterday morning I was actually going to unfriend her because I thought it was a weird scenario until she reacted to my post with her boyfriend (which I know because Emma told me unprompted in the office). So that sort of confirmed the good intentions as well as my perception of her being a detached friend. I was gonna unfriend her anyway along with other not-close friends because BeReal is for CLOSE friends. But in the end, I inadvertently hurt you in a way that I can totally understand, because I would feel uncomfortable and have a problem with that situation as well. And I wanted to apologize for that.

If we’re talking about finding solutions, I already blocked her on all platforms like what I did with the TikTok girls, and I intend to unfollow girls that I personally don’t know well (from Amador or randos with mutual follows).

And I know you probably want some time to recover, but I think it would be nice to see you one last time before I fly out tomorrow and not see you until the next month. I’ll be missing you a lot. I love you, always 🫶",1,6.768389724679999e+17

"top highlights of the day:
1. exploring disney shops and restaurants! we got a 50$ voucher to use for dinner and breakfast
2. fireworks from the hotel (there was a wedding! and when they kissed and when one tried to kiss the other when the other wasn’t looking, it reminded me of us and i thought about you a lot)
3. roomies w gabe!!! great accommodations from the preview team and connecting w the boys (good networking! one of them goes to stanford and he’s hella funny). it’s only west coast people for now bc we wanted to avoid red-eye flight so there’s not too many kiddos here
4. we went swimming in the fountain pool, the kiddie pool (with a giant bucket), and a slide (not pictured) and finished off at the spa (even though we went there after the fountain pool the first time)
tomo we’re planning to go to disney springs and have bfast there… v excited for what’s to come",1,6.77997022183e+17
